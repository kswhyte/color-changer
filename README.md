# Color Changer

The purpose of this project was to honor the requirements for mid-module assessments for Module 1 of the Front-End Engineering program at Turing: School of Software and Design. We were to adhere to a comp given to us in which 2 buttons were needed, one to simply randomly generate a background-color based on the click. The second one allows you to reset your background-color to white. Most of the logic relied on randomly generating hex values along a big enough spectrum to produce inconsistent, or random results.
